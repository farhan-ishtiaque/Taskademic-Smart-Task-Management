# Collaborative Task Management Features - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive collaborative task management features including shared team Kanban boards, task assignment to team members, and the ability to move any team member's tasks between status columns.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Task Assignment System
- **Enhanced Task Model**: Added `assigned_to` field to enable task assignment to specific team members
- **Permission System**: Implemented collaborative permission methods:
  - `can_be_viewed_by(user)`: Check if user can view the task
  - `can_be_edited_by(user)`: Check if user can edit the task  
  - `can_change_status(user)`: Check if user can change task status
- **Dynamic Assignment**: Task creation form now includes team selection and dynamic assignment dropdown

### 2. Shared Team Kanban Board
- **Team-Specific View**: `/tasks/team/<team_id>/kanban/` - Shows all team tasks in collaborative board
- **Four Status Columns**: To Do → In Progress → Review → Done
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Full SortableJS integration for moving tasks between columns
- **Real-time Updates**: AJAX API calls for instant status changes
- **Cross-Member Collaboration**: Team members can move each other's tasks

### 3. API Enhancements
- **Team Kanban Data**: `GET /tasks/api/tasks/team_kanban_data/` - Returns organized task data
- **Assignment Endpoint**: `POST /tasks/api/tasks/{id}/assign_to_member/` - Assign tasks to team members
- **Status Change**: `POST /tasks/api/tasks/{id}/change_status/` - Update task status with permissions
- **Team Members**: `GET /teams/{team_id}/members/` - Load team members for assignment dropdown

### 4. Enhanced User Interface
- **Assignment Badges**: Visual indicators showing who tasks are assigned to
- **Quick Assignment**: Modal dialogs for reassigning tasks directly from Kanban board
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded task cards based on status and assignment
- **Responsive Design**: Bootstrap integration with mobile-friendly interface

## File Changes Summary

### Core Models (`tasks/models.py`)
```python
# Added collaborative assignment field
assigned_to = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, blank=True, related_name='assigned_tasks')

# Added permission methods for collaboration
def can_be_viewed_by(self, user):
def can_be_edited_by(self, user): 
def can_change_status(self, user):
```

### Views Enhancement (`tasks/views.py`)
- Added `team_kanban_board` view for shared board interface
- Enhanced `TaskViewSet` with collaborative API actions:
  - `team_kanban_data` - Returns organized task data by status
  - `assign_to_member` - Assigns tasks to team members
  - `change_status` - Updates task status with permission checks

### Templates
- **`team_kanban_board.html`**: Complete collaborative Kanban interface with drag-and-drop
