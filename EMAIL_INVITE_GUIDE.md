# 📧 How to Check if Your Email Invite Worked - Simple Guide

## Quick Answer for Your Situation

Based on your screenshot, you have:
- **1 Team Member**: asfiya2003 (Owner)  
- **1 Pending Invite**: chowdhuryasfiya01@gmail.com

## 🔍 How to Check Invite Status

### Step 1: Use the Status Checker
1. Go to your team page: `http://localhost:8000/teams/`
2. Click on "TEAM SHUROKKHA"
3. Click the **"Check Status"** button (new blue button I just added)
4. This will show you detailed information about:
   - All pending invites
   - Which invites were accepted
   - Task assignments for each member

### Step 2: Check the Terminal/Console
Since this is a development setup, emails are printed in the console instead of being sent to real email addresses.

**Look at your terminal where you ran `python manage.py runserver`** - you should see the email content there when you sent the invite.

## 📋 Understanding Invite Status

| Status | What it Means | What to Do |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| **🟡 Pending** | Invite sent but not accepted yet | Person needs to click the invite link |
| **🟢 Accepted** | Person joined the team | They can now be assigned tasks |
| **🔴 Expired** | Invite expired (7 days) | Send a new invite |

## 🎯 Task Assignment Process

### Before Someone Accepts the Invite:
- ❌ Cannot assign tasks to them
- ❌ They don't appear in assignment dropdown
- ❌ They cannot see team tasks

### After Someone Accepts the Invite:
- ✅ They become a team member
- ✅ You can assign tasks to them
- ✅ They appear in the assignment dropdown
- ✅ They can see and work on team tasks

## 🚀 Step-by-Step: From Invite to Task Assignment

### 1. Send Invite (✅ You already did this)
```
You sent an invite to: chowdhuryasfiya01@gmail.com
Status: Pending
```

### 2. Check if Invite Was "Sent" (Development Mode)
Since you're in development mode, the email is printed in your terminal:
- Look at the terminal where `python manage.py runserver` is running
- You should see email content with an invite link

### 3. Simulate Accepting the Invite
Since this is development and emails don't actually get sent:
- Copy the invite link from the terminal
- Open it in a browser
- The person would need to log in or create an account
- Once they do, they'll automatically join the team

### 4. Assign Tasks to the New Member
Once they accept:
- Go to **Create Task**: `http://localhost:8000/tasks/create/`
- Select "TEAM SHUROKKHA" as the team
- The person will appear in the "Assign to" dropdown
- Create the task and assign it to them

### 5. View Team Collaboration
- Go to **Team Kanban Board**: `http://localhost:8000/tasks/team/<team_id>/kanban/`
- You'll see all team tasks organized by status
- You can move anyone's tasks between columns
- Assigned tasks show who they're assigned to

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the email in terminal"
- Make sure you're looking at the correct terminal
- The terminal should be running `python manage.py runserver`
- Send another invite and watch the terminal

### "The person can't find the email"
- In development mode, emails aren't actually sent
- You need to copy the invite link from the terminal
- Share that link directly with the person

### "I can't assign tasks to them"
- They need to accept the invite first
- Check the status page to see if they're a team member
- Only team members appear in the assignment dropdown

## 📞 For Production (Real Email Sending)

When you deploy this application:
- Configure real email settings (Gmail, SendGrid, etc.)
- Emails will be sent to actual email addresses
- People will receive real emails with invite links

## ✅ Summary for Your Case

Your invite to `chowdhuryasfiya01@gmail.com` is **pending**. Here's what you should do:

1. **Check the terminal** where your Django server is running - you should see the email content
2. **Copy the invite link** from that email content
3. **Share the link** directly with the person (since real emails aren't sent in development)
4. **Once they click the link and join**, they'll appear as a team member
5. **Then you can assign tasks** to them using the create task form
6. **Use the Team Kanban Board** to see all team work together

**Use the new "Check Status" button on your team page to monitor everything!**
